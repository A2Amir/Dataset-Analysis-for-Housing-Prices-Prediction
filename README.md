1.  How to work with missing data?

      *   Steps for working with missing data:

             * Identify missing data

             * Deal with missing data

             * Correct data format

2.  Data Standardization and normalization

  <pre>
  Data is usually collected from different agencies with different formats.(Data Standardization is also a 
  term for a particular type of data normalization, where we subtract the mean and divide by the standard 
  deviation)

  What is Standardization?
  Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format which allows the researcher to make
  the meaningful comparison. 

  Why normalization?
  Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range.Typical 
  normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, scaling the variable so the variable 
  variance is 1, or scaling variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1.

3.  Distribution of Variables

4.  Correlation between variables
    *  Continuous numerical variables: Continuous numerical variables are variables that may contain any value 
        within some range. Continuous numerical variables can have the type "int64" or "float64". A great way to 
        visualize these variables is by using scatterplots with fitted lines. 

        * Positive linear relationship
        * Negative linear relationship
    * Categorical variables:These are variables that describe a 'characteristic' of a data unit, and are selected from
      a small group of categories. The categorical variables can have the type "object" or "int64". A good way to visualize
      categorical variables is by using boxplots.
      
    * Descriptive Statistical Analysis
    
5.  Basic of Grouping: The "groupby" method groups data by different categories. The data is grouped based on one or several
     variables and analysis is performed on the individual groups.

6.  Correlation and Causation:

    * Correlation: a measure of the extent of interdependence between variables.

    * Causation: the relationship between cause and effect between two variables.
    <pre>
    It is important to know the difference between these two and that correlation does not imply causation.
    Determining correlationis much simpler  the determining causation as causation may require independent 
    experimentation.
    </pre>
    * Pearson Correlation: The Pearson Correlation measures the linear dependence between two variables X and Y. The resulting                                    coefficient is a value between -1 and 1
    * P-value:What is this P-value? The P-value is the probability value that the correlation between these two variables is statistically significant. Normally, we choose a significance level of 0.05, which means that we are 95% confident that the correlation between the variables is significant.
    
    * ANOVA: Analysis of Variance, The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test whether there are significant differences between the means of two or more groups. ANOVA returns two parameter.
    
7.  One example of a Data  Model that we will be using is **Simple Linear Regression**.Simple Linear Regression is a method to help us understand the relationship between two variables.

8.  Multiple Linear Regression:is very similar to Simple Linear Regression, but this method is used to explain the relationship between one continuous response (dependent) variable and *two or more* predictor (independent) variables.

9.  Polynomial Regression: is a particular case of the general linear regression model or multiple linear regression models.We get non-linear relationships by squaring or setting higher-order terms of the predictor variables.There are different orders of polynomial regression.

10. Measures for Evaluation:two very important measures that are often used in Statistics to determine the accuracy of a model are:

    R^2 / R-squared
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
