1.  How to work with missing data?

      *   Steps for working with missing data:

             * Identify missing data

             * Deal with missing data

             * Correct data format

2.  Data Standardization and normalization

  <pre> Data is usually collected from different agencies with different formats. 
  (Data Standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization, where we 
  subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation)

  What is Standardization?
  Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format which allows 
  the researcher to make the meaningful comparison. 

  Why normalization?
  Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range.
  Typical normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, scaling the variable so 
  the variable variance is 1, or scaling variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1. </pre>

3.  Distribution of Variables
4.  Correlation between variables
    *  Continuous numerical variables: Continuous numerical variables are variables that may contain any value within some range. Continuous numerical variables can have the type "int64" or "float64". A great way to visualize these variables is by using scatterplots with fitted lines. 

        * Positive linear relationship
        * Negative linear relationship
    * Categorical variables:These are variables that describe a 'characteristic' of a data unit, and are selected from a small group of categories. The categorical variables can have the type "object" or "int64". A good way to visualize categorical variables is by using boxplots.
    * Descriptive Statistical Analysis
    
5.  Basic of Grouping: The "groupby" method groups data by different categories. The data is grouped based on one or several variables and analysis is performed on the individual groups.

6.  Correlation and Causation:

   * Correlation: a measure of the extent of interdependence between variables.

   * Causation: the relationship between cause and effect between two variables.

It is important to know the difference between these two and that correlation does not imply causation. Determining  correlation is much simpler  the determining causation as causation may require independent experimentation 
    
   * Pearson Correlation: The Pearson Correlation measures the linear dependence between two variables X and Y. The resulting coefficient is a value between -1 and 1
